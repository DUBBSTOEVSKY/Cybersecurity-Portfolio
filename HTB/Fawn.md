## Decoding Web Protocols with Hack The Box

### Introduction

Diving into cybersecurity is no walk in the park. Hack The Box has been my training ground. Recently, I tackled an exercise focused on web protocols. This wasn’t just another task—it was a critical step in mastering the basics of web communication.

### Exercise Overview

In this exercise, I dissected a web page. The mission was simple: understand the key protocols that power the web and see how they fit into cybersecurity.

### Key Protocols and Their Impact

1. **HTTP/HTTPS**
   - **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**: Before this, HTTP was just a part of URLs. Now, I see it as the language of web communication. Watching HTTP requests and responses was like decrypting a coded exchange.
   - **HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)**: HTTPS isn’t just a padlock icon—it’s encryption in action. Learning how HTTPS secures data has given me a new level of awareness about online security.

2. **DNS (Domain Name System)**
   - DNS is the internet’s directory. It translates domain names into IP addresses. Seeing DNS at work was like watching a well-oiled machine, connecting users to websites seamlessly.

3. **IP (Internet Protocol)**
   - IP is the internet’s delivery system, directing data packets to their destinations. Understanding IP addresses has revealed how data travels across networks and where vulnerabilities can lie.

### What I Gained

- **Decoding Web Communication**: Understanding HTTP/HTTPS, DNS, and IP has given me the tools to tackle web security issues head-on. I now grasp how web browsers and servers communicate, which is crucial for identifying threats.

- **Spotting Secure Connections**: HTTPS stands out as the frontline defense for data security. Recognizing secure connections is essential for protecting online interactions.

- **DNS and IP Insights**: Grasping DNS and IP operations has armed me with the skills to troubleshoot connectivity issues and identify potential security risks. Knowing the internet’s infrastructure is key to effective cybersecurity.

### Conclusion

This Hack The Box exercise wasn’t just another item on my checklist—it was a strategic move to understand the core protocols of the web. With this knowledge, I’m better equipped to secure the online world. The journey continues, and I’m ready for what’s next.
